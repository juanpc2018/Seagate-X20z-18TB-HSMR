No Warranty info Available, Contact Support.
No Specifications.

Works Ok, but i don't think those passed the Quality Test,
or has a Helium Leak.
Temperature is 18°C when cold,
40°C when working, 
but Temperature does Not lower fast like a Normal HDD "Strange"
can be used but Not Non-Stop in Datacenter 24/7 365 2.5M/h MTBF, Extreme Heat & Vibration Environment.

i guess it does Not have Official Specs .pdf
because all drives have different specs. Some worse than others.
